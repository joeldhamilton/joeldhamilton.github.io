### üîç Featured Projects
#### TripleTen Final Project - Telecom Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Strategy Optimization | July 2024 
- Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Interconnect, a telecom operator, to enable proactive retention strategies and improve customer loyalty.
- Increased churn prediction accuracy by 84.66% compared to the baseline model, achieving an AUC-ROC score of 0.9233. Engineered 12 key features from raw customer data, performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis, and implemented advanced machine learning techniques including XGBoost and SHAP analysis.
- Identified top 3 predictors of customer churn (total charges, charge per month, and monthly charges), providing actionable insights for targeted retention efforts. Developed data-driven recommendations for optimizing pricing strategies, promoting longer-term contracts, and enhancing high-value services like fiber optic internet.

#### TripleTen Project 9 - Data-Driven Oil Well Location Optimization
- OilyGiant, a mining company, needed to determine the best location for a new oil well to maximize profits. The project aimed to analyze oil well data from three regions, build predictive models, and recommend the optimal region for development based on profitability and risk assessment.
- Developed a high-performing linear regression model for Region 1 that achieved an RMSE of 0.89, significantly outperforming models for other regions. This was accomplished by implementing and comparing linear regression models across three regions, utilizing feature engineering and careful data preprocessing techniques.
- Conducted comprehensive risk analysis using bootstrapping techniques, resulting in the identification of Region 1 as the optimal development location with an expected profit of $4.39 million and only 1.7% risk of loss. This was achieved by performing 1000 bootstrap iterations to estimate profit distributions, calculating confidence intervals, and assessing risk levels for each region.

#### TripleTen Project 13 - Time Series Forecasting for Taxi Order Prediction
- Sweet Lift Taxi, a company operating at airports, needed to predict hourly taxi order volumes to optimize driver allocation during peak hours. The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to forecast taxi orders for the next hour using historical data.
- Developed a high-performing Random Forest model that surpassed the project's target RMSE of 48, achieving an RMSE of 42.80 on the test set. This was accomplished by implementing and comparing multiple time series forecasting models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SARIMA, while leveraging feature engineering techniques such as lag features and time-based attributes.
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis that revealed crucial patterns in taxi order demand, resulting in effective feature engineering and model selection. This was achieved by analyzing hourly, daily, and weekly seasonality patterns, performing time series decomposition, and examining autocorrelation structures to inform the modeling approach.

#### TripleTen Project 14 - Automated Sentiment Analysis System for Movie Review Classification | July 2024
- The Film Junky Union, an emerging community for classic movie enthusiasts, required an automated system to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to accurately detect sentiment in user-submitted reviews.
- Developed a high-performing sentiment analysis model that exceeded the project's target F1 score of 0.85, achieving an F1 score of 0.88 on the test set. This was accomplished by implementing and comparing multiple text classification models, including TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and BERT embeddings.
- Optimized model selection and feature engineering processes, resulting in a computationally efficient solution that outperformed more complex models. This was achieved by conducting thorough exploratory data analysis, implementing various text preprocessing techniques, and performing comparative analysis of model performance across different architectures.
